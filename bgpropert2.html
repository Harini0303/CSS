        <b>Web development</b> is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] <em>Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.</em> A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.

        Among Web professionals,<i> "Web development"</i> usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.[2] <u>Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.</u>
        
        For larger <strong>organizations and businesses</strong>, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.[3] Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers. Since the commercialization of the Web with Tim Berners-Lee[4] developing the World Wide Web at CERN, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.
