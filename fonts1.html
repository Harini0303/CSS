    <p>The term “full-stack” refers to all of the technologies and skills that are needed to finish a project. Each of these is called a “stack.” To put it another way, stacks can be made for mobile, the Web, or software. Plenty of the time, a software engineer works on either the front end or back end. In other words, the full stack is a set of frameworks, libraries, and tools for both client and server software that help make an application or website work well.
        From the beginning to the end, a development project is in the hands of a full-stack developer. Professionals are well-versed in the ins and outs of various environments and integrations, as well as the various frameworks, libraries, and tools that go into building a successful app or website. As a result, full-stack developers are familiar with the frontend as well as the backend of a website’s technology. What’s more is that they are well-versed in server, network, and hosting settings, as well as frontend and backend languages and frameworks. Some full-stack developers have the ability to create websites and web applications all on their own. They are fluent in front-end web development languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is important to add that they’re also fluent in back-end web development languages like Ruby and Python. Full-stack developers have the ability to save business money and resources as they can work on both the front end and the back end of a project on their own. Most full-stack engineers (55.2% back-end and 37.1%) claim to be in the latter category, according to research conducted by Stack Overflow in 2020.
